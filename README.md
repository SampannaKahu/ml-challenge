# Machine Learning challenge code

## What is this?
This is the source code for the ML challenge organised at Flipkart (my current workplace). The aim was to detect the RTO fraud.
We were given labelled user data, woth the labels stating whether an entry is a fraud of not. The objective was to train on this data and build an ML model that could predict whether a certain order is fraud or not.

## Tools, libraries and software used
Due to the competition rules, we were allowed to use only the following tools:
* Python2.7
* Scikit-learn
* Numpy
* Pandas

## Where is the data?
Unfortunately due to confidentiality reasons, the data for this challenge can not be revealed. This is in accordance to Flipkart's policy of non-disclosure.
Therefore, all the columns names in the source code in this repository have been obfuscated.

## How to run?
Given the csv file with the training, simply run the rto9.py file. This is the file with the best results so far.
